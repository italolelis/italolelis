### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ’»

Iâ€™m a Brazilian living in Berlin, Germany. Currently working as CTO @Lykon. Previously, I worked @N26 and @HelloFresh mostly doing things in Go. I enjoy working with distributed systems and solving complex problems. Go has been my language of choice since 2015 to help me achieve these things while having a great deal of fun. 

Today, I spend most of my free time contributing to Open Source projects, making lots of coffee and enjoying life at its best.
