### Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Italo Vietro

Iâ€™m a seasoned engineering leader and currently Head of Engineering at Parloa, architecting the core services behind Europeâ€™s leading agentic-AI customer-service platformâ€”turning complex real-time conversations into fast, reliable experiences for millions of users daily. 

My journey here began well before the first bot greeted a customer. As VP of Platform at Babbel I rebuilt a global learning engine that quietly serves language lessons across the globe. I then served as VP of Engineering at Urban Sports Club, raising a brand-new TechHub in Spain, tripling delivery cadence and replacing ad-hoc heroics with transparent goals and steady, compounding gains. 

Earlier I was CTO at Lykon, bootstrapping a 40-plus-microservice health-tech stack from scratch while reinforcing the habit of open RFCs and blameless post-mortems. At N26 I led 40 engineers across core banking systems, shifting sign-offs to squad ownership and instilling "you build it, you run it, you own it" as everyday culture. 

Those legs of the trip began at HelloFresh, where I advanced from Senior Software Engineer to Head of Engineering. Together with an incredible crew I shepherded the leap from monolithic PHP to cloud-native Go services, cracked the 100-engineer scale and let Fridays remain "friday-beers" daysâ€”not crunch sessions.

All of it arcs back to my formative years in Brazil: seven years that carried me from junior enthusiast to technical lead, and taught me that the best systems and the best teams thrive when knowledge travels faster than code.
