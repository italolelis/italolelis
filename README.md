### Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Italo Vietro

I'm currently the VP of Platform at Babbel. I enjoy finding practical solutions to complex problems and helping teams build reliable, scalable technology. My days are about collaboration, innovation, and ensuring our platform meets usersâ€™ needs.

Before Babbel, I served as VP of Engineering at Urban Sports Club. It was a rewarding experience working with a talented team, establishing a TechHub in Spain, and exploring ways to make our operations more efficient. I focused on setting clear goals and improving our hiring processesâ€”simple, steady efforts that support bigger results.

Earlier in my career, I was CTO at Lykon, where I built a team and developed a platform with over 40 microservices. It taught me a lot about making transparent technical decisions and fostering robust engineering habits.

At N26, I led a team of 40 engineers working on our core banking systems. We aimed to make decision-making more decentralized and improve operational efficiency, which was a meaningful challenge.

My journey in Germany started at HelloFresh, where I grew from a Senior Software Engineer to Head of Engineering. Transitioning to microservices, shifting from PHP to Go, and scaling the team were significant milestones, and I appreciated the collaborative spirit that made it possible.

My tech story began back in Brazil, where I spent over seven years learning and growing from an entry-level developer into someone who could lead projects and inspire teams. That foundation continues to fuel my drive for learning and sharing.
