### Hi there 👋 💻

I'm Italo, and I'm based in Berlin, Germany. 

Currently working as VP of Platform Engineering @urbansportsclub. Previously, I was heading the technology department as CTO @Lykon. I also worked @N26 and @HelloFresh, mainly growing outstanding teams, fostering a good engineering culture, and doing things in [Go](https://go.dev/). I enjoy working with distributed systems and solving complex problems.

Today, I spend most of my free time as a volunteer mentor @techstars and as a volunteer teacher @ReDI-School, making lots of coffee and enjoying life at its best.
