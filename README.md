### Hello 👋 I’m Italo Vietro

At the moment, I’m steering the ship as VP of Platform at Babbel. Here, I blend my love for innovation with practical technology solutions. My days are filled with leading our platform product team, sparking innovation, and ensuring everything scales smoothly.

Before this adventure at Babbel, I had the fantastic opportunity to shape my future as VP of Engineering at Urban Sports Club. It was a wild ride overseeing a vibrant team of over 100 brilliant minds, setting up an efficient TechHub in Spain, and slashing operational costs by 20%—all in a day’s work! The role had me rolling up my sleeves to set up key engineering KPIs and revamp our hiring strategy. Transforming an ambitious company into a powerhouse was no small feat, but hey, that’s what I thrive on!

Taking a stroll down memory lane, I was the CTO at Lykon, where I built a team from the ground up. We crafted a platform with over 40 microservices—a testament to our hard work and dedication to innovation. This role taught me the importance of transparent technical decision-making and resilient engineering practices.

Before Lykon, at N26, I captained a talented crew of 40 engineers, focusing on the bedrock of our core banking services. The goal was to empower teams to make sound decisions and streamline operations, and we nailed it!

My German saga began at HelloFresh, where I climbed from Senior Software Engineer to Head of Engineering. Transitioning to a microservices architecture, moving away from PHP to Go, and scaling the team were monumental tasks, but we made it happen together.

But let’s rewind even further to my roots in Brazil, where my tech journey kicked off. Over seven incredible years, I evolved from a Junior Engineer cutting my teeth on code to leading major software projects.
